## Project Overview

The project is designed to implement a system that demonstrates DevOps practices, which can include:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing and quality checks
- Deployment automation
- Containerization using Docker (if applicable)
- Version control with GitHub

This repository can be used as an example or starting point for learning and implementing DevOps practices in software development.

## Features

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: An automated pipeline that handles building, testing, and deploying the application.
- **Containerization**: Use of Docker for containerizing the application for easier deployment and scalability.
- **Automated Testing**: Tests to ensure the application behaves as expected.
- **Deployment**: Ability to deploy to local or cloud environments using scripts or services like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

## Prerequisites

To run and set up this project locally, you will need the following:

- **Git**: For cloning the repository and managing version control.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and running it in isolated environments (optional but recommended).
- **Node.js**: If the application uses JavaScript/Node.js for its backend.
- **npm or yarn**: For installing dependencies if applicable.
- **Jenkins** (optional): For running CI/CD pipelines.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KarinyCCTB/FinalExam_DevOps1_Kariny.git
   cd FinalExam_DevOps1_Kariny
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   If the project requires Node.js or other dependencies, install them using npm or yarn. For example:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Docker Setup (Optional)**

   If Docker is used for deployment, build the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker build -t finalexam_devops .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 finalexam_devops
   ```

   This will run the application on `http://localhost:5000` (or whichever port is configured).

4. **Running the Application**

   To run the application locally, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` (or another port depending on your configuration).

## Running Tests

If the project includes automated tests (e.g., unit tests), they can be run using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all defined tests in the project. Make sure your environment is properly configured to run tests (e.g., testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for the backend (if applicable).
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for easy deployment.
- **Jenkins** (or another CI/CD tool): Used to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
- **MongoDB** or other databases (if applicable): Used for data storage.
- **Jest/Mocha**: Testing frameworks (if applicable).
- **GitHub Actions** (optional): For automating CI/CD workflows directly in GitHub.
